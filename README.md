# Chicago Ethereum Meetup QF / CLR pilot

## Background

`// TODO: Add info about quadratic funding and constrained liberal radicalism`

## Instructions for participating

#### Date range

Tue Feb 11 2020 6pm CST - ~ Tue Feb 18 2020 6pm CST (not exact: using block number and average block time)

#### Steps

1. Approve the contract to spend token on your behalf

   `// TODO: Add Etherscan link`

1. Optional but a good practice: Take a look at [the contracts](<(./contract-project)>) to confirm they do what we say they do.

1. Contribute to a project

   `// TODO: Add oneclickdapp link`

#### Getting initial funds for voting

`// TODO: Add HackMD link`

#### Using additional funds

It's DAI, so in theory if you feel strongly you can contribute as much as you like.
